### About

This repository contains the source code of "Artificial Neural Networks: Theory and Applications" course (EEE950). The neural networks implemented were:

- Adaptive Linear Element (ADALINE)
- Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
- Perceptron
- Radial Basis Function Network (RBF)
- Single Layer Perceptron (SLP)

All methods were implemented in R. Each folder contains a report in Portuguese, whose purpose is to describe each method with examples in synthetic and real databases.
